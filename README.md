- Advantages and disadvantages of using Git

When you take a look at the defenition in google of git you will see that Git is a version Control system (VCS)
    **What is version Control system?**
    
# ***A version Control system:***
* A system that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time
* Sharing on multiple computers
* Logging where be changed
* If you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover 

# ***Types of VCS***

There are 3 types of VCS:
1. Local Version Control System 
2. Centralized Version Control System
3. Distributed Version Control System

## **_Local Version Control System_**
For example "Skype"

A local version control systtem has advantages(+) and disadvantages(-):
   +This approach is very common and simple
   -The chances of accidentally writing to the wrong file is higher
That's why this methode is changed and another `VCS` is appered which is *`Centralized Version Control System`*

## **_Centralized Version Control System_**

The best example of *`Centralized Version Control System`* is [*_SVN_*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion)

Also this type of VCS has advantages(+) and disadvantages(-):
   +Relatively easy to set up
   +Enable admins control the workflow

   On the other hand
   -If the main server goes down developers can’t save versioned changes
   -Remote commits are slow
   -If the central database is corrupted the entire history could be lost (security issues)

That's why this methode is changed and another `VCS` is appered which is *`Distributed Version Control System`*

### **Distributed Version Control System**

For exemple : Git

As you can see in this table we can see the devolpere of different of verrsion control software

* Open-Source System: it is a system for which the source code is freely and easily available. This source code is the original one which can be further modified.
* Distributed System: it is present on the server.Also, it can be taken from the developer’s computer. This means that the repository is present in a distributed network apart from the central server.
* Control System
* Version Controlled: Whenever more and more code is added to the folder, the code present in the Git folder gets changed.
